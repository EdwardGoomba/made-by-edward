Im Edward. I design and develop stuff - mostly for SaaS startups and businesses looking to build products. I work by myself at the self titled <a href='https://edwardvdesign.com'>Edward V Design.</a> Most days its swell, some days suck, other days I live under a rock. Such is life when you work for yourself.

I have been mulling what to do with the extra stuff I have been coming up with related to, and not related to design and development. Im a huge believer of intentional living and in sharing our experiences with others. This is the point of this.

> <strong>Made by Edward</strong> is my 'journal' where I encourage sharing of ideas, knowledge and experiences among fellow creatives while following a path of intentional living.

### Totally jumping on board this Gatsby band wagon

If there is anything I have learned over the past few months since I first heard about Gatsby, is that its at a minimum a great blogging platform. Initial thoughts - you have to do things the Gatsby way. Combining Markdown and React - im a fan. Getting things with GraphQL (if you cant tell, I am clueless when it comes to this as of now) - cool beans, I have been wanting to learn GraphQL.

Overall:

- Easy to setup
- Uses React
- Easy to deploy

### Whats Next
Over the next few weeks im goign to continue building this out into a few page site. Ill keep you posted. I have been putting this off for a long time, and think this is the year I just need to go ham and do all the things I keep talking about doing. I want to look back at the end of the year and say 'That was a wild ride.' Yea, thats all I kind of have for now. Cheers!

#### Edward, Out
